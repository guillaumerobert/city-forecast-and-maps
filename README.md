This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The aim of this project is to pratice with React, dealing with routes, api request with fetch or axios.
It doesn't pretend using all good practices in React, and it's pretty straight forward (leaving Flux or Redux on the side).
Api used are totally free, please register for your own api keys if you clone the project...
